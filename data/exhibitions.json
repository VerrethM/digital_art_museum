    "content": "Ernesto Artillo is an incredible Spanish artist that works for scores of fashion labels like Celine, Elie Saab, Six Lee and Mango to give their ad campaigns that creative elevation. Merging fashion imagery with anything from flowers, cliffs, renaissance paintings or architectural structures, to create a beautifully surrealist outcome. Artillo often uses images that he has taken himself. “For me, collage means detaching from my tendency of keeping everything in order. I’m constantly trying to become more abstract and less geometric. It allows me to literally cut/break with things – even though they are my own pictures – to create a new order. I suppose collage makes me challenge my own conventions.”",

She grew up in a family of artists and her art experiments started during childhood and at age 12 she had her first group exhibition shocking the audiences with huge canvases of nudes drawn in charcoal. Her art breaks the boundaries of how the body and facial features are illustrated through photography in the fashion industry and by using a more relaxed and fun way of looking at things she expressed and embraced the human sexuality in a playful and empowering way. Bold colours and abstract shapes play a big part of Andreea’s work. Her energetic illustrations attracted the eye of various global brands and publications.",

His collages explore human identities by deconstructing the faces of famous figures such as Kate Moss, Lana del Ray or Naomi Campbell. Embellished with colourful flowers, there is something utopian about Monreal’s representation of fame and human character. Still, the idea of his art is to find real beauty – the one obliterated by things that are immediately appealing and please the eye.",
